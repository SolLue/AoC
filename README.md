Started /trying/ to do the AoC in 2021, had to stop after a few days. 
Then in 2022 I got to day 9. I needed too long to actually do the problems each day.
2023: managed to get to day 21 or so. Also needed too long, done with University at this point but obviously am not familiar with a lot of algorithms etc. 
Takes too long to implement them.
So therefore, I will try to do all past AoC's until next years Advent to get better and faster at problem solving. 

Mostly I will focus on Java, want to do more C and Python later on.
